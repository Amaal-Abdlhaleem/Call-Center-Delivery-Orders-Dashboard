# Call Center Delivery Orders Dashboard
This is my submission for "FP20 Analytics Challenge 6". 
The challenge dive into the world of food delivery service which shapes the future of the restaurant industry.

There are some useful insights using Power BI:
- Average delivery time: This KPI is crucial for measuring the efficiency of delivery service.
- Drivers efficiency.
- Order completion rate: To measure customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- Average tip per delivery: To measure customer satisfaction and reward high-performing drivers.
- Peak ordering time: To understand when most orders are placed.
- Understanding the relationship between average delivery time and sub total over months.
- Understanding the relationship between total customers and discount time over months.
